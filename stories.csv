1,All of the women in my family die at age 27. I turn 28 in 2 hours and 32 minutes.,6091,gyb0dz,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gyb0dz/all_of_the_women_in_my_family_die_at_age_27_i/,200,"My dad always wanted a son. He got three daughters instead.

He hated us all, hated my twin sisters, hated my mother… but hated me most of all because I was the last child my mother had before she died. That didn’t stop him from treating me like his little boy, didn’t stop him from attempting to beat the hatred of my own gender into me. *Quit your crying*, he’d snap, *or you’ll end up like your sniveling bitch of a mother*. After years of that shit, he was shocked that I grew up as a tomboy.

I think he hated that even more because I was just a constant reminder of what he never got to have.

My mother died when she was only twenty-seven, when I was only four – the coroner ruled her death a natural passing, some weird heart complication that took her in her sleep. My dad, though, he says it was because of her family’s curse. Whenever I came to him, desperate for more information about a mother I never really knew, he never had much to say. I’m convinced he was just drunk since the day she died. *Every woman in her damn family, they die when they’re twenty-seven*, he’d sputter in between belches, his breath reeking of stale beer.

I think the real curse is that my mom was the one to die, and not him.

I wasn’t fully convinced by the ramblings of a perpetually drunk man, but when I lost both of my sisters just months before their twenty-eighth birthday, I knew it couldn’t be a coincidence. Moira was found murdered, her face practically blasted off by a shooter while she was on a jog. Joy took her own life only days later. I was the one who found her, hanging in the bedroom of her apartment as I came to pick her up for Moira’s funeral. She’d been there, swinging from the rafters, all night.

It’s hard to live a normal life when you know you have an expiration date, especially when it encompasses an entire year. I always dreaded my birthday, which from an early age became associated less with fun and birthday cake and more with worry and funeral caskets. But once Moira and Joy died, my next birthday – twenty-five – was the most dreadful day of my life. Twenty-six was worse, twenty-seven unimaginable.

*This is it*, I thought as I closed all of the blinds in my apartment, downing the last drop of vodka in the bottle. *This is the last year of my life.*

Twenty-seven has been uneventful, to say the least. Why would I make any long-term plans, forge any meaningful relationships when I know they simply cannot last? The worst part of this last year has been simply *not* knowing when my impending death is coming – it could have been any day within the last three hundred and sixty-four. It could be within the next minute.

I must admit I became something of a recluse, my windows always shuttered, additional locks installed in my door, letting the phone ring through to voicemail, hiding under my covers with the lights out whenever I got a knock on my door. I stocked up on preserved foods and various goods that I would need to last the year. I was so paranoid that I even covered my mail slot, stuffed a towel in the space beneath my front door. I didn’t want anything getting through from the outside world – god forbid, an *anthrax letter*.

Falling off the face of the earth didn’t matter much, anyway – I didn’t have friends or family anymore. My mother and both of my sisters were dead, and my dad disowned me when I came out as a lesbian after my sisters died. I moved away and severed contact soon after.

The night before my twenty-seventh birthday, I started getting these strange phone calls from a blocked number. I’ve always had anxiety about phone calls, so I just let it ring. The number kept calling, at least once per day throughout the past year. Then the knocking started, once a week at first, but it’s only been getting worse – more frequent, and the pounding on my door more frantic each time. Convinced it had something to do with my inevitable death, I’ve been driven mad by the unknown visitor, especially over the past week.

I got ready for bed last night, knowing that tomorrow – today, now – is the day I will turn 28. My time had run out, and I searched for comfort in a bottle of liquor. I didn’t find it. I fell into bed, drunk and delirious, and prayed the morning wouldn’t come, though I knew it would. I eventually got to sleep, but it was restless and unsatisfying. The kind of sleep where you feel like you have one eye open, always watching.

That’s why I was quick to wake when the door to my bedroom creaked open early in the morning, before the first sign of light. I shot up in my bed, glancing around my room in a frenzied panic, at first seeing nothing out of the ordinary other than the door, pushed slightly ajar. A closer look revealed something I’d missed, something that sent my heart racing, froze me to my core. Two dark figures stood in the empty space behind the half-opened door, unmoving, almost like a pair of statues.

Waiting. Watching. Wordless.

“Leave me… leave me alone,” I squeaked, unable to move, paralyzed in the power of their presence.

The shadowy figures instead shuffled out from behind the door, creeping slowly towards me in the dark. I knew this would certainly be the end of my life, the fulfillment of my curse, if I didn’t act. Suddenly recalling the self-defense methods I’d drilled into my mind, I flipped my bedside lamp on to stun the intruders and reached underneath the table to pull the knife I’d duct taped there a year ago – a twenty-seventh birthday gift to myself.

As soon as the light flooded the room, though, I knew the blade would be of no use.

My intruders were not a pair of assassins – not human ones, at least. In the yellow light of the lamp I discerned the identities of the dark figures. They were my sisters. Joy stood at the foot of my bed, pale, in that same conservative black dress I’d found her dead in years ago, the one she’d picked out for Moira’s funeral. Her head hung at a right angle to her shoulders, neck grotesquely bent from her hanging.

Moira was a few steps behind her. I could only assume it was her, considering the severity of her injuries – she’d suffered a gunshot wound to the head, so brutal that we were not allowed to see her after her death, so intense that it had entirely disfigured her face. The lower half of her face had been reduced to a pit of gore, her jawbone barely attached on one side, her mouth mangled, with only several teeth remaining studded randomly throughout the mess.

“Why are you here?” I cried, gathering my knees to my chest and holding them tight. “Are you… are you here to take me?”

Joy made a feeble attempt to shake her head, the side of her face only brushing weakly against her shoulder. She waited several moments before putting one of her feet in front of the other, moving towards the side of my bed. As I recoiled instinctively, she slowed her pace. Moira trailed after her until they were both beside me.

I whimpered as Joy leaned over me, her head flopping forward suddenly with the motion, neck cracking sickeningly. With her lips brushing against my ear, she whispered, “she… she tried.” Her speech was labored and wheezing, as if her vocal cords had nearly been shredded.

“What do you mean, Joy?” I pleaded.

Her lips moved against my ear once more, but no sounds came out despite a clear strenuous effort. Moira wagered an attempt at answering my query, but only succeeded in sputtering blood from the gaping wound in her face, ejecting one of her remaining teeth onto the floor as her jawbone swung precariously, barely hanging on. She raised one hand, slowly curling it into a fist before striking her knuckles furiously against my bedpost.

The incessant sounds startling me, I forced my eyes shut tight and pulled my knees even closer against my chest. Moira’s knocking seemed only to escalate in volume, seemed to go on forever, until – finally – it stopped. I cracked my eyes open to find that both of my sisters had vanished, that the light of early morning had begun to spill in through the slats of my blinds. It was just past six o’clock, the seventh of June, the day of my twenty-eighth birthday.

I was born at 9:26 AM – once I learned of the curse, I burned the time of my ultimate expiration into my mind. I only had three hours and sixteen minutes left to live… if I even *had* that long. Draping my covers over my head, I resolved to spend the rest of my life asleep. I figured I’d rather pass peacefully in my sleep like my mother did than to suffer a fate similar to my sisters’.

My plans were interrupted, however, by that damned knocking on the door. The interruption usually didn’t come so early in the morning. I decided initially to ignore the strange visitor but pulled the blankets back down soon after as a certain sense of familiarity struck me. The pounding on the door reminded me all too much of Moira’s knocking just moments before.

It easily could have been a trick of the curse, but something compelled me to approach the door. “What do you want?” I called from behind the barrier, clinging to the relative safety it provided.

The reply came from an unfamiliar man’s voice. “I just have a letter for you, miss.”

“Just… just slide it under the door, and please leave,” I returned, using my bare foot to remove the towel I used to block the small space beneath it.

He deposited a bright yellow envelope under the door as I requested. I waited quietly for the sounds of receding footsteps before sliding on a pair of gloves to handle the letter. It was addressed to me, simply by first name and with no address. Carefully, I unsealed the envelope to reveal a birthday card. I hadn’t received one in years.

Bright, sparkling letters on the front formed the words, *Daughter, you’re 27!*. I scoffed at the sick joke. I hadn’t received a birthday card since I was a child, and my dad couldn’t even get my birthday right. I didn’t think he even knew my address. I cracked it open gingerly to read the message inside.

*Laura,*

*If you’re reading this, your father has killed me. Don’t believe a thing he or the police say – I was not the target of a random attack, I did not die of natural causes, and I certainly did not commit suicide. I would never leave you if I had the choice.*

*The truth is… I died is because I found the truth behind my family’s curse and foolishly told your father. He was in on it the whole time, planted in my life by some secret society to eradicate me. To eradicate us. What we have is not a curse, it is a gift – a gift of immense power. The power to heal, but the power to harm just the same.*

*We come into our power at the age of 28, a number associated with independence, leadership, and self-sufficiency. An age where we can handle the responsibility such a power inevitably comes with. It’s a strong number, and you will come into great strength, though you’ve always been a strong girl.*

*I hope you’ve made it this far, but at the same time… I know you have. You were always a feisty little girl for the four years I had the pleasure of knowing you, of loving you. You never let anyone tell you what to think or do – especially not your father.*

*Happy birthday – I love you.*

*Mom*

I closed the card softly, thinking on the strained words of my sister – mom had tried to warn them, but they didn’t listen. The pieces of the puzzle slid into place… my dad must have murdered Moira, and Joy ended her own life out of grief and a belief that she would inevitably be next.

At the time of writing this, I only have two hours and thirty-two minutes until I officially turn twenty-eight. Over the past hour or so, I’ve already begun to feel the power flowing into my body, electrifying as it runs through my veins. I will the towel to reposition itself under the door, and it does so, sliding across the floor on its own.

I need to keep myself safe until 9:26, after all. I’m planning on surprising my father with a visit [for my birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).

2,My girlfriend hasn’t moved in months,2217,gy5ee9,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gy5ee9/my_girlfriend_hasnt_moved_in_months/,101,"This all started about 4 months ago, we were looking at apartments together. Amy was so excited, this would be our first apartment together. I can still recall the happiness in her voice when she talked about organizing our bedroom. We finally settled on a newly built apartment building in a new development. 

The apartment was beautiful, but there wasn’t much nearby. Just a grocery store, railroad tracks and a pond. Amy expresses her joy of walking down to the pond and feeding the ducks. We signed our lease and began moving in. We spent the first few nights at our old apartments. My parents were bringing up their truck to move my bed in, but they were out of town for a few days. We finally were able to bring my bed over and Amy and I were officially moved in. I bought a bottle of champagne to celebrate. It was one of the happiest days of my life. All of that came to a crashing halt when I woke up the next morning. 

I was a little bleary eyed and hung over, but I noticed Amy wasn’t in bed with me. I looked up to see she was standing in the corner of our room, face turned toward the wall.” Amy, what are you doing,” I asked. No response. She didn’t move, she didn’t turn around, nothing.” Amy what’s wrong?” I got up and put my hand on her, she was stiff as a board. I tried to pull her away from the wall but she wouldn’t budge. I pulled with all my might but I couldn’t break her away from the corner. It’s like she was magnetized to the wall. I started to freak out and called 911. 

I told them I needed an ambulance and that my girlfriend is unresponsive. While I waited for the ambulance to arrive I reached out to her parents.” Hey, it’s me David, you guys need to get here now. I found Amy standing in a corner and she won’t respond.” “Who is this,” her father asked.”it’s me David, didn’t you hear me? Your daughter is in trouble and you need to get here fast.” “I don’t know a David, and I don’t have a daughter either. I think you have the wrong number pal.” He hung up on me. 

I frantically looked through my phone to see if I called the wrong number, I didn’t. I could see all the previous times I had called that number. I even found the text conversation with him about planning Amy’s birthday. Her father Phil likes to joke around but he took it too far this time. I called him back, straight to voicemail. I yelled into my phone.” Look Phil, I don’t know what your problem is, but this is no time for jokes. Something is severely wrong with Amy and you need to get her now!” 

As I hung up the phone there was a knock at my door, it was the police. I opened the door and I explained everything. I took them into my room to see if they could get her to move.” Son is this a joke,” the officer asked.” What do you mean, please just see if you can help her.”” Where is your girlfriend,” the office said.” There’s no one in that corner.” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I became explosive and started to yell.” I don’t know what’s going on here but you need to help my girlfriend, I need to know if she’s okay.” The officer told me to calm down or he would detain me, after a quick sobriety check to make sure I wasn’t on drugs, he decided to leave. I begged him to stay and help her. He told me to stop wasting the police’s time and then left. 

I ran back over to Amy to see if I could try and move her. She was still standing in the same exact position, hadn’t moved in an hour. I bent down to get a look at her face. She had a blank expression. I noticed that she was still breathing and blinking.”please Amy,” I begged,” tell me what’s happening.”I tried to move her again to no avail.  That’s when I looked up and realized that her plant that she kept on the windowsill was gone. When I looked around the room I noticed everything that she owned was gone. 

I ran into our closet, all of her clothes had just disappeared. I frantically ran all over the apartment, nothing. Everything she owned, that we spent days moving into this place, have just magically vanished. Even her car was gone. I decided to contact the property office to see if they caught anything that happened to her car on camera. When I explained they situation they told me that I rented that apartment by myself.” What, no I didn’t,” I cried.” You guys saw Amy and I sign the lease agreement. Can you please just look through the parking lot footage from last night.” The guy said he would but assured me that my signature was the only one on my lease agreement. I went to find my copy and sure enough, all her signatures and initials had disappeared from the paperwork. I felt like I was going to vomit. 

My head was spinning with a million questions. I spent the next few hours trying to get Amy to budge from that corner. I eventually gave up and cried myself to sleep. When I woke up the next morning my situation hadn’t change. She was still standing in that corner, hasn’t changed position since I first saw her. I tried to move her again but she was like a rock. I noticed she was still blinking and breathing so I tried to communicate.” Amy, if you can hear me blink twice.” Nothing, I decided to ask again.” Amy, if you know what is going on blink twice.” Again, nothing happened. She didn’t really seem to be blinking in a pattern or anything, just blinking sort of normally. I felt like I was losing my mind, I had no answers to why this was going on. I spent the day trying to contact other friends and family. Everyone had pretty much the same response. They all claimed they didn’t know her, and had no recollection of who I was. 

She was an honor student in high school and always made the honor roll. I tried searching the Internet for any school records, nothing. It was like Amy had vanished off the face of the earth, yet she was still back at our apartment. I spent the next few days searching the Internet trying to find any information on Amy. I never found any. Weeks started to go by. 

Everyday I would wake up and see Amy still standing in that corner. She never moved a muscle. Everyday I would try and move her, I never could. I became desperate for answers. I started going on religious/paranormal forums. I would ask anybody and everybody if they have ever seen or heard of anything like this. I went to forums on Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Pagan, paranormal investigator, even magicians. I asked everyone I could. Nobody had any answers. Nobody had ever experienced or heard about anything like what was happening to me. 

Eventually I just gave up. It’s been 4 months since this happened, I’ve gotten use to it. I try to spend as little time as possible in the bedroom. I really only go in there to sleep or get dressed. I feel so heartbroken, like I’ve lost Amy. Yet every night I see her just standing there. Still hasn’t moved one bit in 4 months. Still just blinking, still just breathing. I could just sleep out on the couch but I like listening to her breathing when I’m trying to sleep. Hearing her breathe is soothing to me. 

I see her everyday but I feeling like I’ve lost her. This apartment is so quiet without her. I miss her voice, her smile. I miss the arguments, and most of all her bubbly personality. It pains me so much to look at her now. Just to see her standing there, not moving. That blank expression every time I look at her face. I can’t take this anymore. I was planning on finding another place to live and move on. Then, yesterday morning the unthinkable happened..... she moved. 

I woke and found that Amy was no longer in the corner, she was standing at the foot of my bed. She had a big smile stretched across her face, her teeth were showing. She was no longer breathing or blinking. She was staring directly into my eyes. I just sat there in shock. I have no idea how long we were staring at each other, neither of us moved a muscle. Finally I cried out, “ Amy what’s going on, what happened to you.” She didn’t say anything to me. She started to slowly lift up her hand and stretched it towards me. It was as if time stood still. She never broke eye contact. I yelled out,” What are you doing Amy? I haven’t spoken to you in so long. Please just tell me what’s happening.” 

She finally spoke to me.” David, it’s time for you for you to come join me. Take my hand David, come with me.” I haven’t heard her voice in so long, I broke down. I jumped out of bed and grabbed her face.” Please Amy, I beg you, just tell me what’s happening. What has been going on with you.” She never spoke another word after that. She just stood there smiling with her hand stretched out. She never broke contact with me. I decided that I can’t stay here anymore. 

I packed and was ready to leave. I had made a reservation for a hotel and I was going to stay with my parents until I could find a new place. As much as it pains me I needed to move on. Whatever this thing is in my bedroom isn’t Amy. As I was packing my bags I looked over at Amy and she had a tear running down her face. She still hadn’t moved since this morning. Still smiling and still stick her hand out. Amy and I had been through so much together, she was the love of my life. It was like my heart was being ripped out from the thought of leaving her here. I decided to cancel my hotel reservation and spend one last night with her before going to my parents. 

As I laid in bed I had this incredibly uneasy feeling. She wasn’t breathing this time. Every time I looked up all I could see was her standing there. Still smiling, staring right at me. I didn’t sleep well that night. When I woke up I had received dozens of text and phone calls. 

All of them were from unknown numbers. Every text I read was apparently sent by Amy. They were all urging me to come join her, all I have to do is grab her hand. I starting to listen to the voicemails. It was Amy’s voice, she was crying.” David please, I need you to come with me. Please I need you to grab my hand.” Every single voice mail was the same. I looked back at Amy, she still had her hand out. I miss her so much. I would like nothing more than to see her again. I’ve already sent goodbye texts to my family and friends. A lot of them are trying to call me right now but I’m not answering. As I’m writing I noticed Amy’s eyes have started to bleed and her smile has become a lot more twisted. I hope I’m making the right decision here.",1591530734.0
3,My mother was a baker,126,gybodg,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gybodg/my_mother_was_a_baker/,9,"My mother was a baker. When I was small she’d sit me on the countertop and feed me the most delicious pastries and cakes and pies I’d ever tasted, eyes twinkling with delight at every positive note I gave. She would work at a recipe until it was perfect, pouring her entire heart and soul into every dish and waiting on tenterhooks for the satisfied moans she knew came from us with every bite.

Father was a foodie. I think that’s why he fell in love with her in the first place. Mother adored cooking and father could eat and eat and eat and eat until his shirt buttons pulled and his stomach threatened to burst. Never much of a cook himself, father very proudly worked for Marshel Foods, a canning factory in town. He’d often say that it was the closest he’d ever come to making a delicious meal.

I remember the day the factory closed. Mother and I were in the kitchen, the smell of warm cinnamon sugar tickling at my nose, when father swayed through the door. I’d never seen him drunk before. He stumbled his way to the living room and collapsed unceremoniously into his arm chair, bottle of golden syrupy liquid sloshing in hand. 
That evening I was sent to bed early with a plate of fresh cookies and a glass of warm milk. I drained the glass quickly and pressed it against my bedroom wall, listening closely to the hushed apologies from father and his desperate promises to find a new job, whatever it took, and that all would be okay. 

I remember when mother taught me to make pie crust. Her expert hands made light work of rolling dense pastry, forming each little rose decal with floured fingers so delicately I was mesmerised. We ate in silence that night, father yawned into his food, sipping languidly on a finger of that same golden liquid. He’d spent the morning making calls and scouring the papers for work to no avail. Mother smiled at me from across the table, though it did not touch her eyes. 

I remember trying to sleep through the hissing voices in the living room. Father angry at his 10-some years wasted with a company who could so easily disregard him. Mother trying her hardest to keep him calm, to encourage him as she always had. I could hear fathers slurred words becoming more incoherent as the evening went on. The sound of the neck of a glass bottle tapping heavily against the lip of a tumbler seemed to echo through the house endlessly that night. I didn’t know one human could consume so much liquid.

I remember the colour of mother’s first bruise. Blue like the sky, purpling in places and almost green in others. She wore her hair down that day, letting the soft strawberry-blonde tendrils brush gently over her swelling eye. Then she taught me to make white cake, her own mother’s favourite. She let me lick the icing from the spoon. 

I remember the day father stopped making phone calls. His beard had grown long and his stomach hung freely out of his shirt, too large and swollen now to be concealed. I watched a bead of sweat roll from his forehead and land on the dinner table. I shuddered at the thought. 

I remember hearing mother scream for the first time. A sound so unnatural I wasn’t sure it was real. The sharp, shrill sound stung my ears, reverberating around my body and forcing bile up into my throat. I knew what he was doing, what he was taking from her. 

I remember the first time I tried to ask him to stop. I woke early and peered in mother’s doorway. Even in sleep she was beautiful. I tiptoed downstairs to find father half awake in his arm chair, hungover and stinking of rot. He looked at me through bloodshot eyes, squinting as the early morning sun forced its way through the curtains like an unwelcome guest. I opened my mouth to speak, but the words never came. Instead, a sharp, burning sensation made itself known across the left side of my face. My head snapped at the force of his open palm. I spent the rest of the day in my room. Mother baked brownies and left them outside my door, but father got to them first.

I remember my 12th birthday. Mother made chocolate cake adorned with spirals of fresh sugar soaked strawberries, my favourite. Father ate his slice in his arm chair, the crumbs tumbling down his wiry beard and collecting on the bulging ridge of his stomach. Mother winked at me from the kitchen as I stood in the doorway coveting my piece. I’d come to learn that if I didn’t eat quick then father would gobble up everything in sight, leaving nothing but the crumbs on his shirt. 

I remember the day father stole from me. I lay stiff and cold in my bed. Mother’s screams had turned to silence early that night and my stomach twisted anxiously. It knew before I did. 
Fathers footsteps were heavy and lazy, pausing often on the stairs while the owner took breath. He stumbled and wheezed his way across the hall, through my door and into my bed. When he left, I dreamt of him. Grunting like a stuck pig and sweating all over me. I woke up stinking of his rot. 

I remember the look on mother’s face when she realised what he’d done. Her soft features were hard and dark, like seeing an angel shrouded in blackness. 
She held my hand under the dining table while father gorged himself, snorting and gasping with every bite of dinner. He didn’t seem to notice our empty plates- or maybe he didn’t care. We left him to sleep in his arm chair that night. Mother crawled her delicate frame into bed with me and held me while I wept and finally fell to sleep, the sound of fathers guttural snoring fading quietly into nothingness.

I remember waking up alone the next morning, an unbelievably delicious smell pulling me from my slumber. I made my way to the kitchen and took my usual place on the countertop next to mother. She was humming a beautiful tune, smile tugging gently at the corners of her lips as she washed the red from her hands. I helped her roll thick pastry, helped her make delicate rose decals. The filling was already prepared. 
 
I remember watching steam swirling gracefully from fresh pies cooling on the kitchen windowsill, my mouth watering impatiently. I stifled a laugh. 

I guess father made a delicious meal after all.",1591562579.0
4,"When I was younger, I was told I was never allowed to leave my room after 9pm, one night I discovered why.

[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gxctma/when_i_was_younger_i_was_told_i_was_never_allowed/)

I was frozen to the spot. The body twitched for several minutes before it slowly got up. It got up! 

There was blood all around it. I whimpered as it turned its blood soaked face toward my fear stricken one. I sat still for a moment before it began to slowly shuffle toward me. It’s arms reaching out. 

As it edged closer to me, I screamed, I screamed till my throat was red raw. The body, the animated corpse. It was my mother. 

The red room was small, quite rectangular so I didn’t really have many places to run to. The good thing was, the corpse that was my mother was slow so I was able to get away from her by walking to the other side of the room. I knew that I couldn’t do that forever and it wasn’t sustainable but for now, it would do. I just couldn’t bear to look at my poor mother’s face. 

‘’Mum, please.’’ I pleaded with her. 

‘’Mum. What happened to you. Where’s dad?’’ 

I knew that she would be incapable of answering my questions, due to the fact that she no longer possessed a tongue. Could she understand me? I didn’t know. 

This clearly wasn’t my mother anymore. She was staggering towards me, her stance likened to that of a zombie. Hell, she was a zombie. Blood oozed out of her mouth, her teeth black. Her eyes were entirely devoid of any life, any emotion. She was empty, a husk. All that was left of her was the awful essence of the Baba Yaga. These were the consequences I was telling you about. 

Let me tell you a bit about my mother. She was always kinder to me than my father was. Sometimes when my father would order me to my room even though I was hungry and they failed to feed me, I’d catch these little sympathetic glances from her toward me. Little sideward looks of pity. Still, she did very little to help me. 

My mother was always the one to leave me food outside my room though, always the one leaving me bottles of water to drink, especially in the summer when temperatures were stifling and I was still confined. I always had a feeling that my father attempted to forbid these somewhat kinder gestures but she continued. I really appreciated her for that. 

But other times, she could be just as cruel as my father was. She could be unkind and that would confuse me. She was the one that bestowed the gift of the Russian book that first introduced me to Baba Yaga. 

My parents barely ever spoke to me, aside from the usual ‘Go to your room, Anna’ or ‘Stop crying, Anna’ So when I received the book, I took it as a kind gesture, from my mother. I had no idea that it would turn into my being pursued and haunted by something that was supposed to be a simple, kind deed. The receiving of a good book. How was I supposed to know that this would happen to me. All I ever yearned for, was love and I never got it. Was she cruel to me? Yes. Did she love me? I doubt it. Nevertheless she was still my mother and I loved her. I never wanted to see her like this. 

The dead thing that was my mother continued to pursue me in slow, deliberate motions but I managed to dodge her advances every single time. I knew I had to get out of the red room, but how? I didn’t even know where I was. I was sure I was no longer in our house since we didn’t have any rooms that resembled this nightmare. 

My thinking was shrewd, fast. I picked up several candles and threw them at the corpse and watched as it writhed in agony but still, it was relentless. It just kept coming and coming. Trying to grab me at every turn. Strangely, as I threw the candles at my mothers corpse, I noticed that nothing else in the room was setting alight. The candles would hit the corpse and then just extinguish after hitting the floor. It wasn’t normal but then nothing was normal here. I decided to try something else. 

I ran towards the scattered books. I picked up my fairy tale book and I quickly moved toward the spell book before my dead mother got too close to it. I picked it up, thinking the reanimated corpse of my mother was the doing of this spell book so I wanted to burn it. I tried to set it on fire but it just wouldn’t burn. I picked up several candles and tried to set it ablaze but nothing happened. The book stayed perfectly intact. 

Then suddenly, I heard a piercing shriek. It shook the room like an earthquake. The dead body of my mother fell to the floor, lifeless once more. The red room crumbled around me and as I shut my ears to stifle the sound, I noticed they were bleeding. I fell to the ground, the books scattering around me. Before I lost consciousness, I vaguely remember Baba Yaga flying across the collapsing room towards me on her mortar, aided by the pestle that also doubled up as her ‘wand’. Her spindly knees touching her crooked chin as she flew. 

I saw her blood soaked mouth and her wide, demonic eyes coming toward me as my own eyes fluttered shut. 




I awoke startled, disorientated and completely engulfed by fear. I touched my face, my eyes, my mouth, everything was still there, still attached. I felt for my pulse, it was beating, albeit erratically. My heart was still intact. 

I looked around me and cried out. I was in a forest, a deep birch forest surrounded by thick trees. The body of my mother was there too, it lay, surrounded by candles not too far away from me. The body was limp, unmoving, dead but I was cautious about taking my eyes off of it, just in case. My attention was stolen away by a slow but monotonous chanting, the same chanting that I heard when I was back at the house. Amongst the chanting, I could also hear a plethora of different sounds, whispers and cries. It was the cries and whispers of children, men and women. I could hear the anguish in the voices of those lamenting. I stood up and that was when I saw the hut. The hut that was supported by giant blood covered chicken legs. 

I stared at it, horrified. The sight was picturesque, it looked just like the painting at the house and frighteningly resembled the illustrations from my book. I took a step backward when I saw it’s legs begin to...move.",1591571233.0

I was about 6 months old and a relatively loud whiney baby. Not proud to admit it but what can you do about it when you're that young. After being born my family moved into my grandads house as it was financially better for us to have a roof over our head and all to live together for the short term. 

Altogether was myself, my mother, father gran and grandad.  I'm now 27 just to try and put a time and date of when this happened. The house is a big, 1800 Victorian house with 4 levels. It has a creepy history and the story goes that my grandad bought the house from a doctor/surgeon. Who would often bring his work back home and have procedures inside the house. As we all know...not all are successful and one of the rooms (now I've moved out) I've discovered which one was the morgue...

 For once it was only just me and my mum in the house as everyone was out for work or so I thought. She was going about her daily chores whilst having to look after a 6 month old baby. I had just been taken out of the bath and carried to my crib, being placed on the bed to be dried with a towel gently wrapped about me. My mum could smell the cooking start to burn as she had forgot she had put on a small pizza earlier on that day. In a panic she made her way to the kitchen which was on the other side of the house but on the same floor whilst grabbing a baby monitor on her travels. Finally pulling the toasted remains of the pizza out of the oven she could hear my cries through the monitor as she would expect...(who would like to be slightly wet laying on a bed who can blame me?) all of a sudden the atmosphere in the house suddenly changed and what my mum heard next still sends shivers down our spines of the family to this day. 

As my mum recalls she heard a soft but faint voice of an older woman trying to shh me to sleep. In a way of what you would expect from an older relative say grandparent. My mum at first though it was some interference but when she started to hear my cries turn into silence she panicked and like any other mother would do, she dropped the burnt pizza and ran as fast as she could to the room I was laying. I am now tucked up in my cot, blanket pulled at neck level as if somebody had physically moved me into a sleeping position. My mum rang the police in a panic and they had arrived within 20 minutes, searching the house from top to bottom and no sign of any break in. The police officers could tell by mums expression that this was no joke but after trying to calm the situation they left and it was just me, my mum and whatever the presence was still remaining inside the house. This is just one of a few stories involving the 'old woman in the victorian house'...",1591523200.0

**FROM DR. QUINN’S NOTES**

I know I can’t just sit and do nothing. Not after what I’ve found. I need to make what I’ve found public, so that it never happens again.

I have substantial evidence, but I have a nagging feeling that I’m missing something. What caused the breach in the gas canisters? Were they sabotaged on purpose? Did somebody release the gas intentionally into the facility, knowing what it would do to all the employees?

Unfortunately, I don’t have many leads. Dr. Holloway is in a coma, and Dr. Hausten is dead. However, I’m wondering if Dr. Hausten’s family knows anything about the experiments RepiGen was conducting, or knows who else was involved. I’ve found the number for Dr. Hausten’s widow in the phone book. I’m going to see if she has any information.

---

**PHONE CALL WITH TRISH HAUSTEN**

**AQ:** Hello, Mrs. Hausten?

**TH:** Yes, this is she. Who’s calling?

**AQ:** I’m terribly sorry to reach you at such a difficult time. My name is Dr. Ava Quinn, and I’ve been hired by your husband’s employer to investigate the disaster that happened at the lab. I was wondering if you would be willing to answer a few questions.

**TH:** I don’t know why you think I have any useful information, but ask away. What happened was awful. Greg is so broken up about it.

**AQ:** I’m sorry?

**TH:** So many of his colleagues died. He’s barely left the house since that day.

**AQ:** Mrs. Hausten, I was told that your husband was killed in the accident.

**TH:** Who told you that? That’s ridiculous. He’s sitting in the living room right now. Tell you what, are you in the area? You’re welcome to come over and chat with him. I’m sure he would do anything to help figure out what happened.

---

**INTERVIEW WITH GREGORY HAUSTEN**

**AQ:** How are you doing, Dr. Hausten?

**GH:** I’ve been better. But I’m alive and in one piece. Have you met with Rena Holloway yet?

**AQ:** No. As far as I know, she’s still in a coma.

**GH:** Very well. Despite all that’s happened, I still wish her a speedy recovery. There’s been enough death.

**AQ:** Dr. Hausten, I appreciate your allowing me to speak with you. I’m sorry that it’s so soon – I’m sure that you’d rather be spending time with your family. But as you know, RepiGen is very concerned about the cause of this accident, and they’ve asked me to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible.

**GH:** I completely understand. The good news is, you’ve found it.

**AQ:** Found what?

**GH:** The bottom. I know what caused the gas leak, and it was no accident. It was Rena Holloway.

**AQ:** Go on.

**GH:** Let me start at the beginning. Dr. Holloway was a gifted student when she joined our lab. As soon as she got her degree, we made her a full-fledged member of our team. We all adored having her on board. Smart as a whip and incredibly talented.

**AQ:** I see.

**GH:** But she flew too close to the sun. Our proverbial Icarus. You probably know that I was exploring ways to regenerate lost limbs. Rena was one of the lead researchers on that project, and at first, her contributions were invaluable.

**AQ:** So I’ve heard. Dr. Holloway is the one who developed the methyltransferase disinhibitor?

**GH:** You’ve done your research, Dr. Quinn. Very impressive. Yes, that was her little pet project. Unbeknownst to the rest of us, she wanted to take it farther than I had ever intended. She started to perform some… unsavory experiments. Do you know about them?

**AQ:** Growing mindless human duplicates. Yes, I’ve heard.

**GH:** I know I speak for everyone at the lab when I say we deeply regret that we didn’t stop her. She was a genius, you know. Even more so than we’d realized. She designed a system in which the team that performed each successive step of the experiment was completely in the dark about the steps that came before or after. One team would sever a limb; the next treated the limb with the regeneration cocktail; the third poked and prodded at a fully-formed human that had no knowledge of its origins. It was brilliant. In an extremely unethical way.

**AQ:** No one had any idea what she was doing?

**GH:** Not a soul. Otherwise, we would have put an end to it.

**AQ:** So what led to the accident?

**GH:** Rena had become increasingly unhinged. She had begun to rant. She felt unrecognized. Her contributions unacknowledged. She kept saying she would make a name for herself, one way or another.

**AQ:** Jesus.

**GH:** We were worried about her, of course, but I didn’t know how bad it had gotten.

**AQ:** How did you find all this out?

**GH:** She confronted me. The morning of the accident. Told me everything. That she’d been experimenting with human clones. That she was planning on making her discoveries public and winning the Nobel prize.

**AQ:** I hate to ask, but did she say what she was planning to *do* with the duplicates?

**GH:** I don’t think she had thought it through. She just craved the credit. But the possibilities abound, don’t they? An endless source of manpower for the armed forces. A farm for sex trafficking. A supply of people with no history, no family, who could be bought and sold to the rich for profit.

**AQ:** The thought makes me queasy.

**GH:** As it should.

**AQ:** How did you react?

**GH:** I told her that what she was doing was wrong, very wrong, and she snapped. It was the last straw. She told me that if I didn’t appreciate her contributions, no one would. She stomped off. Had I known she was going to set off the gas, I wouldn’t have left the building.

**AQ:** So you weren’t actually in the room when Dr. Holloway opened the containers?

**GH:** If I was, I would’ve stopped her. I don’t know what she was trying to accomplish, whether she was trying to self-destruct or prove to everyone that her experiments worked. What I’m trying to say, Dr. Quinn, is that sometimes it’s not an entire system that fails. Sometimes it’s just one bad egg.

**AQ:** Understood, Dr. Hausten.

**GH:** Thank you for your time. Now if you’ll excuse me, this has been a very difficult conversation for me. As soon as I’ve had some time to process everything that happened, I do plan to report Dr. Holloway to the authorities. I hope you’ll back me up when I do.

**EMAIL FROM FRANKLIN ROSALYND TO AVA QUINN**

RE: Your investigation

Dear Dr. Quinn,

I anxiously await your final report. However, I have some news that may help you reach your conclusions. I have received word that Dr. Rena Holloway has awoken. She remains in critical care, but is reportedly lucid and able to receive limited visitors. I have taken the liberty of arranging you as an approved visitor on her list. I look forward to seeing what you learn.

Sincerely,

Franklin Rosalynd

---

**FROM DR. QUINN’S NOTES**

Since Rosalynd seems unaware that I know he is not a RepiGen employee, I have not responded to his email. I did check with the hospital and what he says is true: I’m on Holloway’s visitor list. If I get to her quickly, I may be able to get her to confirm what Hausten told me.

---

**INTERVIEW WITH RENA HOLLOWAY**

*When I enter the room, I see that Rena Holloway is deeply disfigured. She is in a hospital gown, but on every exposed inch of skin, there are angry scars: her legs, her arms, even her face scored with wounds that have been stitched but have yet to heal.*

**AQ:** Dr. Holloway.

**RH:** It’s okay, Dr. Quinn. Go ahead and stare. This is what happens when they surgically remove fifty-seven extra appendages that have grown out of your body.

**AQ:** How did you know my name?

**RH:** You don’t still think RepiGen sent you, do you?

**AQ:** It was you. You were never in a coma. You’re Franklin Rosalynd.

**RH:** I knew that I hired the right gal for the job.

**AQ:** Why did you do it, Rena?

**RH:** You think this is my fault? Maybe you’re not as smart as I thought. RepiGen did this. Greg Hausten did this. I was trying to *stop* them.

**AQ:** Okay. I’m willing to listen to what you have to say. I’ll make my own judgments.

**RH:** I was the one who developed the epi-drugs. It was the subject of my dissertation, and when I joined the lab, I kept working on it. We were doing animal trials. I was tweaking the formula to try to perfect it. But Hausten, like he always does, was trying to step in and take the credit. He was first author on all the papers and I was just a footnote in my own discovery.

**AQ:** It must have made you angry to have your contributions go unrecognized. Is that what led you to set off the gas that killed dozens of people?

**RH:** With all due respect, Dr. Quinn, shut up and listen. Yeah, I was pissed, but I’m not a lunatic. I confronted him and we argued about it. He was saying he’d taken my formula and improved it. That’s when he revealed he was doing the human trials.

**AQ:** You didn’t know about the trials?

**RH:** Not a clue. And I didn’t believe him at first, either. I mean, cutting people’s limbs off to see if they grow back? Without IRB approval? The idea was insane for such an unproven drug. But then he sliced off his own finger just to prove to me that the experiments worked.

**AQ:** I’m not sure how to react to that.

**RH:** Yeah, I wasn’t fucking sure either. I thought he was cracked. But that was a Friday, and by Monday he was right: he’d regrown his finger. I don’t think he was capable of understanding that just because my research worked, didn’t mean that it was ethical to test it secretly on *people* with absolutely no oversight.

**AQ:** Did you report this to anyone?

**RH:** I couldn’t, not until I had more proof. I also didn’t want it to kill the whole project – I mean, the idea was to get to human trials *eventually*, the right way. It got to the point where I couldn’t sleep. I was up all night thinking about what the hell to do about it. I felt so alone.

**AQ:** And all that was happening right before the accident.

**RH:** Exactly. That morning, we got into another argument. I found him in the room where we kept the gas, staring at the wall. Except something was wrong with him. He pretended like he had no idea what I was talking about. He got more and more agitated, and then he attacked me. Viciously, like he was an animal. I managed to get free and slam him against the canister but it broke open and… well, you know what happened next.

**AQ:** So why pretend to be Franklin Rosalynd? Why didn’t you just expose this for yourself?

**RH:** You’ve already demonstrated why I couldn’t be the person to bring this to light. Hausten was devious. He convinced you that *I* was the problem. You think anyone would’ve believed me, a jealous postdoc, over a highly respected male scientist? I couldn’t do it myself. I needed someone objective, someone outside all of this, to find out the real truth.

**AQ:** Why not just tell me about the cloning?

**RH:** What cloning?

**AQ:** You’re saying you didn’t know?

**RH:** I might not have been in a coma, but I can’t leave this hospital. I don’t know what you’re talking about. What are you talking about?

**AQ:** It seems that RepiGen was creating, well, shells of human beings. The drugs worked both ways. The person regrows their hand; the hand grows into a person. I’m not sure what they were doing with these people. Keeping them, testing them. Programming them.

**RH:** That’s… I don’t even know what to say to that. It’s awful. I can’t even say I’m surprised.

**AQ:** Dr. Holloway, I’m not saying I don’t believe you. You seem sincere. But do you have any proof that this happened the way you said it did? I don’t mean to distrust you. It’s just that when Dr. Hausten is telling me one thing and you’re telling me another – 

**RH:** I’m sorry. What? Dr. Hausten?

**AQ:** Yes. I interviewed him this morning.

**RH:** That’s not possible. He’s dead.

**AQ:** He’s, uh, very much not dead.

**RH:** Dr. Quinn, I killed him myself. I smashed his head against the canister so hard his head split open. I stabbed him in the neck with a pen. I’m not proud of what I did. But I saw it with my own eyes. I *watched him die*.

**AQ:** Are you… Dr. Holloway. You mentioned earlier that he cut off his own finger to prove that the drugs worked on humans.

**RH:** Yes, he –

**AQ:** What happened to his finger?

**RH:** Oh my god.

**AQ:** You didn’t kill Hausten. You killed someone who looked exactly like him.

**RH:** He’s still out there. You have to go. Go!

**FROM DR. QUINN’S NOTES**

Gregory Hausten has disappeared. I called 911 as I sped to his home. The police were already there when I arrived. The house was empty, his suitcases packed. Trish Hausten said he left in a hurry and didn’t say where he was going. He’s gone.

I drove to the RepiGen lab to see the bodies for myself. I didn’t get far. The entire facility is guarded by what looks like military police. I don’t dare try to get inside.

To whoever is reading this: don’t try to find me. I had so many missed calls from RepiGen that I had to throw my phone out of the window in case they have some way to track me.

This needs to be known. Gregory Hausten is still out there. He knows how to keep making these drugs. How to keep manufacturing people.

I’m going somewhere safe until I can release this information to the public. And then, I’m going hunting.

I know the truth, and it’s up to me to stop him.

7,Little Ria doesn't look like her mom.,57,gybwm1,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gybwm1/little_ria_doesnt_look_like_her_mom/,4,"My sister got really mad at me the first time I met my niece. It was our annual family reunion and I’d drunk a little too much wine. Told her that the kid must have resembled the father, because he sure as hell didn’t look like her. 

Big mistake. 

My sister's always wanted a child, and she’s always wanted it to look just like her—a little mini-Mary. Not to mention, the father wasn’t in the picture, so that must have been an extra sore spot for her. And to top it all off: the “he” was a “she.” Didn’t I know that “niece” was the girl one? Well, hell. Don’t shoot the messenger. It’s hard to tell what a kid’s got between their legs at that age.

&#x200B;

The next family reunion, and it looked like the kid had hardly aged. “Ria sure is...small for one, huh?” I said. I made sure not to mention that she still didn’t look like Mary, so I thought I’d get off easy, but no such luck.

“She has a developmental issue,” she said, “Thanks for noticing.”

Yeesh. I put it off to Mary being upset this wasn’t the year she could show off that Ria had shot up and begun to resemble her. At least I remembered it was a girl, for chrissake.

&#x200B;

Another year, another reunion and it suddenly struck me that I might have been a bit of a bastard because I couldn’t tell you the first thing about my niece. I put it off to Mary being such a recluse, but I suppose I could have checked in. 

Anyway, Ria still looked like she’d been born yesterday, but I didn’t comment. Learned my lesson on that last time. But you know what? I could finally see a hint of Mary in my niece: she’d got her mom’s dimples when she smiled. Not that it was any easy task remembering what Mary looked like with a smile on her face.

So I said to her, “Ria looks like she’s gonna grow up to be a pretty young lady, sis. Just like her mom.”

And speak of the devil, Mary actually smiled. In her arms, little Ria smiled too, as if to say: *look at us! We’re mother and daughter, in case you couldn't tell*.

“You really think we look alike?” Mary asked.

“I don’t know what happened, but you do now.”

And damn it all if Mary didn’t look pleased as pudding with herself. That year, the reunion was at her place, and she’d pulled out all the stops. She had a pig roasting in her brick oven and she was even having a glass of wine—actually it was the first time I could remember her drinking in years. I guess Ria’s transformation called for some celebration.

“Yup,” I said, “We’ve got another little Mary in the family. Just like you always wanted.”

Mary sipped her wine, winked at me and pointed to the oven.

(Part 1)",14,gyjkl4,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gyjkl4/im_on_display_at_mr_mccallisters_odditorium/,1,"My name is Alice. I need to write that down before I forget it. I don’t know how much time I have before he comes back, so I’m going to try to write this down as fast as humanly possible. We’re all so terrified. There’s about 10 of us, and he hasn’t finished his collection. I need to stop him before- I don’t know. Sorry, let me calm down and start over.

I’ve always been a loner. No siblings, not many friends. I guess I’ve always been more focused on my work. I’ve dated guys, but none of them stick around. They always said I’m too “detached”. I didn’t mind then. I lived in Manhattan, and I always had work to keep me busy. That is, until my parents died unexpectedly. Car crash. I was upset, sure, but I wasn’t very close to my parents if I’m gonna be honest. So imagine my surprise when I got a call from my family’s attorney saying that they left me the house. My childhood home. In the middle of east bumb-fuck nowhere. I begrudgingly packed up my shit and moved down there, hoping I could sell it quickly and get back to my life.

My hometown is very small, an “everybody knows everybody” type of place. So it was very unsurprising that all of my neighbors took extreme interest in me moving back home. The first couple days I was home I was bombarded by neighbor after neighbor pounding on my door, wanting to see “how I was doing” or “what I was up to”, which very quickly became borderline unbearable. It wasn’t until the third day I was there that my childhood friend, Ray, knocked on my door.

“Alice- hey!”

“Oh my god Ray, is that really you?” I’m not a hugger, but when he went in for one, I didn’t pull away.

“Yeah! I heard you were in town, so I figured I would stop by! I’m really sorry about your parents…”

I didn’t really know what to say, so I muttered a thank you. We stood there for a moment, an awkward silence permeating the air. Eventually, Ray spoke again.

“Hey… do you remember that carnival we went to as kids?”

“Oh my god, yes!” I laughed, “Those were always so fun! God, I’m sure there’s about a million cheap stuffed animals from the ring toss stuffed in a box somewhere…”

Ray laughed heartily, “Oh my god, yes! You killed that game!”

“Yeah, I always beat you!” I laughed, and he put on an offended face, clutching his pearls.

“Well excuse me! I was going to ask you to go with me tonight, but apparently I’m not good enough for the ring toss queen, so I’ll just be going…” He joked, dramatically turning around, pretending to leave.

“Wait! The carnival is in town?”

He spun around, a stupid grin on his face. “You bet it is! What do you say?”

I laughed. This was the most interesting thing to happen to me since I got back. “Yeah, that would actually be great! Meet you at 8?”

“Deal!” He smiled, before jogging back to his car and driving away.

We spent the entire evening talking and laughing. I beat him at ring toss (again), and after stuffing our faces with funnel cake, we took a lap around the fair. We stopped in front of a structure I had never seen before.

It was a worn tent in a red and black striped pattern. One flap of the tent was pinned open, the darkness inside almost permeating the air. I shuddered. I don’t know what it was, but something about this tent seriously creeped me out. A large sign was staked into the ground, written in a very floral font, matching the tent in coloring.

*Mr. McCallister’s Odditorium*

“Oh I heard about this place!” Ray exclaimed, breaking me out of my fog. “It’s a freak show, you know, bearded ladies, conjoined twins, that kind of stuff. Let’s go in!” He said, grabbing my arm and dragging me to the tent. I stayed still, pulling my arm out of his grasp.

“Um, I don’t know Ray, I don’t really feel okay with gawking at people’s deformities…”

“Come on, Alice, it’ll be fun!” He said with a tight lipped smile, annoyance in his eyes. Something was off with him. I shook my head, and he grabbed my arm so tight I could see the blood beneath his grip drain from my wrist.

“Alice, let’s just go!” He forced me toward the tent, but I stood my ground, pulling against him, before eventually yanking my arm from his hold.

“Ray, seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you? I don’t want to go in!”

He rubbed his hand over his face, frustrated, before sighing at looking at me.

“Sorry. I just really wanted to go in, it was actually the reason I wanted to come to the fair. But nevermind, I’ll come back another time.” He smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes.

“It’s fine Ray, let’s just walk around some more, okay?”

We walked around for a little while longer, before it seemed like the carnival was starting to shut down for the night. We hopped into Ray’s car and he drove me home. As I was getting out after saying goodnight, Ray stopped me, putting his hand on my arm gently.

“Hey, Alice. I.. I just want to say I’m really sorry.”

“Ray don’t worry about earlier, it’s totally fine.”

There was a strange look in his eyes. He looked almost guilty. His eyes were glistening, tears threatening to fall.

“Alice, I’m so, so sorry.”

Weirded out by his behavior, I just nodded at Ray, getting out of his car and jogging to my parent’s house.

It was almost one in the morning, so I quickly got ready for bed, suddenly really exhausted. I quickly checked that the door was locked, still weirded out about Ray, and I passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow.

At around three in the morning, I woke up to a creaking sound coming from the living room. Trying to tell myself that it was just the house settling, I attempted to go back to sleep, but the creaking seemed to get closer. Getting slightly nervous, I quietly crept out of bed, looking for any sort of weapon, eventually grabbing a decorative clock off the bedside table. *This’ll have to do, I guess*, I thought to myself, internally rolling my eyes at my behavior. *This is a super safe neighborhood, it’s probably nothing,* I kept repeating to myself, as I slowly opened the door, peeking out into the darkness. I didn’t see anything, so I quietly crept into the living room, double checking that the door was locked. I breathed a sigh of relief when it was, and just as I was about to turn around and head back to bed, someone grabbed me, wrapping me in a bear hug. He was strong. Inhumanly strong, and I could see his massive arms and bulging veins, even in the darkness. I tried to scream, but he fought me, dragging me further into the house. He held me with one arm, and I felt him reach into his back pocket, before brandishing a white cloth. He shoved it into my face, holding it over my nose and mouth. I fought, I fought so hard, kicking and screaming, but my vision quickly started to get blurry, and soon, I passed out.

I woke up in a dimly lit room, the fluorescent lighting hurting my eyes. It was bare, save for the metal table I was strapped to. I tried to move, but the restraints were tight. It was when the initial haze wore off that I realized that my entire body was on fire, like I was stung by a million hornets. I wanted so desperately to look and see what was wrong, but my head was in some sort of trap. The pain was agonizing, and I let out a whimper, trying to make as little noise as possible. A few moments later, I heard a metal door open and shut behind my head. A deep voice chuckled, immediately chilling me to the bone. Eventually, a man loomed over my head, a surgical mask covering his face.

“Well, well, well. My little treasure is awake.”

I tried to speak, but I realized my mouth was also in agonizing pain, so I kept it shut.

“You’ll make a fine addition to my collection, Tabitha.”

My eyes widened. I spoke weakly, despite the pain.

“Tabitha? You… you have the wrong person. My name is Alice.”

He laughed, his eyes dancing. “Not anymore it’s not.”

He began undoing my restraints, before eventually releasing my head from the trap I was held in.

“Wha- what are you doing?”

“Well, I figured I would let you be the first to see your new look.”

“My- what?”

He ushered me over to an object covered by a tarp in the corner of the room, before ripping it off with a flourish. I fought back a scream at what I saw.

Tattoos covered my body from head to toe. All over my face, my stomach and arms, my feet. Every inch of skin was covered. I was clad in a small leather bikini and a choker. My hair was dyed black and styled in finger waves, and my makeup was meticulously done to resemble that of the 1920’s. My eyes were electric green, and my pupils were slits, like a cat’s. I slowly opened my mouth, to reveal razor sharp fangs, and a forked tongue.

“Presenting… Tabitha the tattooed lady!” He cackled, insanity in his eyes. I fled to the corner of the room to throw up, and he only laughed harder at my reaction.

“Don’t worry Tabitha, you’ll get used to it eventually.” And with that, a large man burst into the room. Before I knew what was happening, a white cloth was pressed against my nose and mouth, the world fading to black once more.

I woke up in a cage. I recognized the coloring of the small tent immediately. I looked around, taking in the many cages that lined the tent. Every cage was filled with a person, faces twisted with misery. I looked to the tops of the cages, seeing that atop each one, a sign in that similar floral font from the front sign, displayed their names:

*The Siamese Twins*

*The Lobster Girl*

*The Human Skeleton*

*The Reptilian Man*

Those were the only ones I could make out in the dim lighting, the others were too far away to see. A few moments later, people started flooding the tent, ooh-ing and ahh-ing at us. I rushed up to the front of the cage, holding tight to the bars. I called out to the closest people.

“Please, please help me! They kidnapped me, and they’re holding me hostage!”

The couple looked at me, taking in my eyes and body, before beginning to laugh.

The man turned to the woman, “Wow, they train these freaks well, it really ups the creep factor!”

The woman laughed, and they continued their walk, taking in the morbid curiosities surrounding them.

I tried to catch the attention of several other patrons, but they all laughed me off. Tears began to spill down my face, when I heard a mumble to my left.

“Don’t bother, they won’t believe you.”

It was a man in a suit, hair parted down the middle and slicked down. He was traditionally handsome, blue eyes and a strong jaw. It wasn’t until I looked down that I saw his third leg. My jaw dropped.

“It isn’t mine.”

“What?” My eyes snapped up.

“The leg,” he whispered, “It isn’t mine.”

I just stared at him, unable to fully process what was going on.

“Look,” he said, “I’ll explain everything as soon as we’re on the road. He won’t be able to listen in on us then. But until then, I’m James, the three legged man.”

“I’m.. Tabitha, I guess.” I said, eyes lowering, anger warming my belly.

“You can tell me your real name later, okay?” He offered a small smile.

I nodded, before returning to the small stool that sat in my otherwise empty cage. I sat there for what felt like hours, watching the patrons laugh and whisper at my appearance. Tears spilled down my face, but it only seemed to make the patrons laugh more. I could see the sun was starting to set through the small opening created by the tent flap. As I was about to turn away, he walked in.

Ray.

He perused the cages, taking his time. Shock quickly turned into fury as I ran to the front of my cage, growling in pure anger. I shook the bars, screaming until he finally looked over and saw me. The color drained from his face, and he ran over to my cage, making sure he was out of my reach.

“Alice-”

“I’LL KILL YOU RAY, I SWEAR TO GOD-”

“I didn’t mean for this to happen, Alice I’m so sorry-”

“How could you do this to me?!” I yelled, swiping at him.

“He threatened to take my sister unless I could find a replacement- I- I had to save her, I’m so sorry…” Tears were spilling down his face.

“Fuck you. FUCK YOU. As soon as I get out of this hellhole I’ll fucking kill you!”

It was then I heard that familiar cackle that I froze.

“Well hello again, Ray! You’ve brought me a lovely specimen,” He said, patting him on the back, “I can’t thank you enough!” He said, tipping his bowler, before straightening his suit jacket and walking toward the bars of my cage. I attempted to swipe at him, but he caught my wrist, squeezing it until I yelped in pain.

“Now Tabitha, you’re going to be a very good girl, otherwise I’m going to have to sedate you.”

I growled at him, pushing against the bars.

“Fuck you.”

He squeezed my wrist tighter, crushing it. “Now that’s not very nice language to use in front of my guests. Very well- I’ll get Bruce to administer-”

My eyes widened. “No! No, I’ll be good. I promise.”

He smiled, revealing crooked, yellowing teeth, before releasing my wrist. “Very good. Now sit in your chair like a good girl. And, push up your breasts, would you? I want everyone to see my excellent handiwork.” And with that, he turned on his heel, his coattails catching air, before strutting away. I started crying once more, shoulders shaking with my silent tears, before doing as I was asked, and returning to my stool.

“Alice..”

I looked at Ray, pure despair reflected in my eyes.

“Please, go.”

He looked at me one more time, before leaving the tent. He never came back.

For the next two days I did as I was told. I sat, and stayed silent as people took in my appearance. But all the while rage burned in my gut. I needed to get out of here, I just didn’t know how. Towards the end of the night, a drunk man stumbled into the tent. He shook the bars, sneering at all of us, spitting out insults and reaching inside the bars, attempting to grab us. After reaching for me, he spun around, leaning against the bars of my cage. It was then when I saw it. His iPhone was hanging out of the back pocket of his jeans. I saw it, relief flooding my eyes. My golden opportunity. I crept up behind him, slowly plucking his phone out of his pants pocket, before stuffing it in the back of my bikini bottoms. He whirled around at me, taking in my appearance.

“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”

I froze. “I- uh…” An idea struck me, and I swallowed my pride. “I just… wanted to say hello to you, handsome.” I winked at him, trying to keep down the bile rising in my throat.

He smirked, using the bars of my cage as an attempt to steady himself.

“Well… you’re pretty hot, for a freak. Why don’t you let me in that cage of yours?”

It was then that Mr. McCallister showed up, quickly apologizing for my behavior and ushering him out the door. He stalked over to me, lowering his voice.

“I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but you better go back to your chair and sit like a good girl.”

I tried to hide my smirk as I nodded, returning to my stool.

The idiot didn’t have a passcode on his phone, thank god. I can’t call anyone, but there’s no service anyway. He had this app on his phone and I figured this might be a good place to write this down. He’ll be coming back any minute, but please, if you can, help us. We’re about to go on the road to the next town, so hopefully I’ll be able to get some answers from James. I have no clue where we’re going, and there’s no one in my life to come looking for me. I’m scared. God, I’m so scared. Earlier today, I saw them moving several empty cages, blank name plates placed on top.

He wants more of us. And there’s nothing I can do to stop him.",1591589810.0
9,Friend Request,3189,gxsuk6,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gxsuk6/friend_request/,83,"Like a lot of you, my wife and I have been stuck at home; trying to pass the time watching our favorite movies or playing games. One day kinda flows into the next, ya know? It was getting hard to keep things from being too boring, not being able to hang with friends and then when we got our stimulus package, my wife surprised me with a Nintendo Switch. 

At the time the things were pretty hard to come by but somehow she found a guy who had one on eBay for a decent price and it arrived around early April. She even bought me a brand new game to go along with it, something we could play together. Animal Crossing New Horizons. 

I have to admit when I first uploaded the game, I wasn't familiar with the mechanics or the previous entries in the series. But after only about an hour of playing, I found myself hooked.

There was just so much to do in the game, and none of it ever felt tedious. Before I knew it, I was chopping, fishing, bug catching and crafting for hours on end. My wife made me take a break and created her own character. We named our island Amity to represent friendship with the animals, and before long we were fighting over who’s turn it was to grab some Nook Miles (in game points) or to purchase furniture from the store. 

There was always something to do in the game, and I appreciated the fact that it ran in real time because that encouraged a more relaxed play than the usual games I was accustomed to. I saw online some people were using the Switch clock to skip forward days, weeks and sometimes even months at a time; but I was more than happy to play at my own leisure and enjoy what the game had to offer every day. 

Eventually, our little virtual island started to expand. My wife and I were taking turns going to mystery islands to harvest materials or collect more miles, and then gathering enough animal neighbors to cover the entire island. 

Every day we logged in, there was something to look forward to. A new fish to catch, a new fossil to dig up. A visiting character in the town plaza selling shoes or shirts. And the island got prettier with our efforts to plant flowers and pull weeds. I never really considered that this simple game would be so fun. 

Then one day I was on Reddit searching for a way to get the rest of the fruit that we hadn’t found, when I saw people sharing what were called Dodo codes. Basically the games way of allowing for online multiplayer access for anyone in the world. 

“Hey, this is pretty cool. How does it work?” I asked Marcie showing her one of the posts that was talking about turnip prices. 

That was one aspect of the game I had never understood, but it was exciting seeing other players talking rabidly about it like it was the stock exchange. 

“We would have to purchase an online subscription. It’s like 20 dollars for a year I think. But it doesn’t seem worth it. We have a lot of other monthly packages,” she told me. 

I checked it out myself and had to agree, there weren’t many games on the Switch that seemed to function with the online aspect and a lot of people online were complaining. Still, it was enticing. 

I couldn’t stop thinking about ways to make our little island community better, and eventually I just bought a subscription to try it out for 14 days. 

“If we don’t like it, we can turn it off. Besides we are playing this game religiously I figure it’s a good investment,” I told Marcie when she found out. 

We had a little quarrel about it, but eventually when she realized all of the fun features we had available to go to someone else’s island, she was onboard. 

Not a day later we advertised our code on a Reddit message board and asked for anyone to bring us apples and oranges, the two fruits our island lacked. 

But there weren’t any takers. Disappointed we took a break from the game for a day or two, occupying ourselves with other hobbies. 

But I can get a bit obsessive about these things, so eventually I checked the Reddit thread again and discovered we had one user eager to come over. 

>hey, I’m Alex, island is called Dmnit cause why the hell not. Got all the fruits and even a special piece of furniture I know you’ll love. 

I figured what the heck, grab a new code and let him come over. 

In case you are unfamiliar with how online works on this game, it’s a bit of a tedious process. Apparently the codes only work one time and then I have to request that my island be available for visits. I messaged Alex and waited for a few hours before finally getting the chance to play again. 

Then it took a dang five minutes for the connection to be established and he was finally over. 

Like other simulator games, New Horizons gives you the chance to customize your avatar. It looked like Alex was a fairly new user cause he was still wearing the basic clothes from the beginning and a nondescript face. Either that or he just didn’t want to emulate his facial features in the game. 

He ran out from the airport on my island and dropped off the fruits immediately along with the promised rare furniture. 

It was amazing and I quickly texted out a thank you. 

His little virtual character stood there in my town square, tapping his foot and slowly typing back. I waited, wondering if he wanted a tour of our island. (It was still a WIP) and instead he asked “friends?” 

I shrugged, and didn’t see why not so I told him I would send my switch code later. 

Then the connection got poor and we wound up losing signal. When this happens on normal games, your progress is saved but not New Horizons. Those fruits and item Alex had just given me? Gone. 

I sighed in frustration and messaged him on Reddit, explaining what happened but didn’t get a response until late that evening. 

>I’ll come back over when you respond to my friend request. 

I checked my switch home screen and sure enough he had sent me one. 

I scratched my head for a moment, trying to remember if I had sent him my code that would allow him to do that. But I couldn’t remember. 

It was pretty late and Marcie has already got onto me about playing games for so long so I logged off and went to bed. Not thinking anything of it. 

The next day I woke and did my morning workout before logging back on the game and running through the daily list of points to collect. Then I saw I got a letter through the mail from Alex. It included a gift of 10,000 bells (in game currency) and said this:

>sorry about before. Hope to see you and your island again soon. 

I decided to give him a second chance and activated the internet, letting him come on over to our island. Like before, he didn’t waste anytime responding and when he arrived, asked if we wanted to play a timed rally. 

Basically there’s an item in game that lets you challenge each other to catch fish or bugs, and since I had nothing better do I said sure why not. 

We set the timer for five minutes and ran around the island catching as many fish as possible. While we were doing it Alex would occasionally text messages, teasing that he was going to win. 

A few of them were a little stranger though. 

>fun is being with others! 

>I hate being alone. 

>never wanna stop playing. 

>can we be best friends?

That last one took me by surprise. I knew the game had a feature that allowed players to be considered best friends, but every article I had read so far said that doing something like that was risky. 

Apparently a best friend in the game could use their axe or shovel to destroy your island, and that made me a little nervous. When Alex asked for the friend request, our island had just barely made it to 2 stars. Now I was so close to 3 stars and getting more things unlocked, I didn’t want to risk it. 

So for now I just ignored it. Logged off the game and went back to normal life with other hobbies and chores. My wife and I agreed we shouldn’t play too often anyway. 

But every time we did, Alex would shoot us a message. 

>u online?

>u online?

>u online?

Marcie thought it was a tad obsessive. 

“Don’t get me wrong, I feel bad for the kid. He probably has nothing better to do.” She said. 

And when I did have a chance I would either let him cover or go to his island. 

The first time I did I was bit surprised that he hadn’t worked hard to make his island community look great. Despite the fact that the online clock said that Alex has been playing for over 200 hours, the island he had looked like a dump. 

Weeds everywhere along with discarded crafting materials and holes everywhere. Even weirder was how much pride Alex took pride in it. He was eager to give me a tour and I did my best to seem impressed. 

Then of course before I signed off he asked me again to answer his request to be a best friend. 

Now, I have never really played much online before. Before all of this, I was working a 9 to 5 job and even the idea of sitting down to play a game at all seemed far fetched. 

But I figured Alex seemed trustworthy enough, despite his idiosyncratic tendencies. So the next day I responded to the request. Now he could come visit our island anytime. 

“You sure he won’t trash our island too?” Marcie asked. 

“I don’t see any reason he would. We could report him to Nintendo and to Reddit for scamming, he’s just a harmless kid,” I told her. 

I was sure he wouldn’t ruin his switch account being suspended for something like ruining our island. 

So the next day when he asked to come over and play again, I didn’t hesitate. The little sequence played and he stepped out of the airport, but he looked different. 

Instead of his usual attire he was wearing a custom made shirt that said F you. And it gave me a bit of a chuckle. I knew the kid liked to be edgy, and I figured he thought now that we were best friends on the game, he could be himself. 

Most notably though was that Alex was wearing a mask that obscured his avatar’s features. The closest I could describe it is a kabuki mask, and his hair was also covered. 

To be honest at first I wasn’t sure it was actually him. 

As soon as he stepped out onto the island, I made a wave with my avatar and he started to send a chat message. 

>time. To. End. This. 

I don’t know what I thought would happen. But for some reason my controller wouldn’t let me respond. My player was frozen in place. 

>end this. End you. Please end me. 

Then he got out his axe and just started messing everything up. Chopping down trees, digging up flowers. All the hard work my wife and I had put into our island. 

Every islander that came by Alex got out his net and slammed it against their head. Just to piss them off. All while constantly typing out bizarre and dark profanity on the chat. Stuff I can’t even repeat because it was so nasty. 

I kept trying to reconnect my controller, figure out a way to stop him from destroying the entire island. 

Marcie heard me cursing at the tv in frustration and she muttered, “Just unplug the game!” 

I didn’t know if that was a good idea but I was out of options so I reached behind our flat screen and pulled the power cord out of the wall outlet. 

The game immediately died and the screen went black, giving me a moment to just stare at it in disbelief. 

“What happened? Did that kid mess our game up?” she asked. 

I quickly hooked everything up and loaded the 
game. 

It was worse than I thought. As soon as I tried to load my save data, an error message came up. 

>data corrupted. No save file found. 

My jaw literally dropped. 

“That damn kid made us lose all our game progress!!” I shouted as I instinctively threw the controller down in frustration. 

“Told you not to trust him,” Marcie said, shaking her head. 

I was beyond mad. I wanted revenge. As soon as I confirmed that the game was basically irreversibly damaged, I sent an email to Nintendo and reported Alex’s account. Then I went on Reddit and made a post to the message board, warning anyone else to watch out for his scam. 

I did the same thing a few days in a row, determined to get the word out of their cheating and abusive gameplay. 

Nintendo was the first to reply. 

>hello! We recently received a report on an account that doesn’t exist. If you feel you made an error when inputting the console identification number, feel free to send us another email with the correct information. 

I immediately checked Alex’s code. I hadn’t gotten any of the code wrong. 

Had Alex used some kind of hacked account? 

I took a screenshot of the console identification number and sent another email. In the meantime, I got a message from another Reddit user that claimed they knew Alex. 

“I don’t mean to be rude, but I think you’re making a mistake here.” Was their response. 

I quickly typed out mine. 

“Look you may think you know your friend, but Alex was rude and disrespectful to the game. I’m just trying to warn the community of their behavior.” 

Then a few minutes later, I got a response. It wasn’t what I was expecting. 
 
“I don’t know how to explain this…. But Alex died. Back in January. He never even got a chance to play the game. He always talked about how much he loved it though.” 

My blood ran a little cold. It seriously gave me a shiver down my spine. But I wasn’t just going to take their word for it. 

So I privately messaged, providing them what info I could on the console I had that was associated with “Alex.” 

“Someone might be using your dead friend’s game console or hacking it. Very disrespectful of their memory, I’m sorry to be the one to tell you,” I said in the DM. 

>This doesn’t make any sense. Alex never even got the Switch. He was on the list for Make a Wish, but he passed away before he got a chance to enjoy it. 

They sent me screenshots of Alex. Dying. He had cancer. Apparently he was a bigger Animal Crossing fan then I realized. Playing it since the GameCube days. 

Perhaps strangest of all was the clothes that the clothes he wore in the hospital on his last days matched the avatar on the game. 

The next day I got another email from Nintendo. Even stranger than before. 

>we have checked our records and this is not a console identification number that is registered. Recommended that you do not engage with this player as they may be dangerous. 

That was putting it lightly. 

I couldn’t believe it was possible, but I was starting to believe I might have been playing with a dead person. 

That night I lay in bed and thought about the game and Alex for a long time. There didn’t seem to be anyway for this person to exist. But I still couldn’t determine if it was just a prank. 

I messaged Alex’s friend one more time. 

“I know this is probably a strange request. But do you have proof that Alex died?” 

“You’re a sick bastard to ask something like that. Go rot in hell.” 

They blocked me from Reddit and I was no closer to finding the truth. I was pretty sure I never would. 

Instead I contacted my local store and asked them about getting a replacement Switch. 

“As soon as we get one in again, we’ll give ya a call.” 

It took three weeks. And I forgot all about the bad and strange experience. Then I got a new console and my wife made a suggestion. 

“Let’s start a new account. Clean slate. And this time let’s try to not play online so much.” 

I agreed with that and got the system set up. Then I started up animal crossing again and started a brand new Amity Island. 

The screen went black just as the title came up. It glitched for a second. And then I saw what looked like a ghostly apparition of Alex. 

My hands got clammy. My mouth dry. His strange soulless eyes stared at me through the screen and a message appeared. 

> u online?

I haven’t played games much since.
